Overview
This is a FastAPI-based API for managing user transactions. It allows users to retrieve transaction records, update transactions, and perform other transaction-related operations.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the FastAPI Transaction API:

Clone the Repository:
1.  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-transaction-api.git
2. cd fastapi-transaction-api
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Database setup
5. Environmental variables setup
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
  
6. Running the application 
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up


Design and Architectural Decisions
Technology Stack
FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
Alembic: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
Pydantic: Data validation and serialization using Python type hints.

Error Handling
The application handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.



Scaling Strategies
As your FastAPI Transaction API grows and serves a substantial user base, consider the following scaling strategies:

1. Load Balancing: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application instances. This helps distribute the load and improves availability.

2. Horizontal Scaling: Add more server instances to handle increased traffic. Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes can automate this process.

3. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load. Use caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.


4. Asynchronous Processing: Offload non-urgent tasks (e.g., background processing, email notifications) to message queues and process them asynchronously. Use tools like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for this purpose.

5. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Use CDNs to cache and serve static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) to reduce server load and improve content delivery speed.

6. Database Optimization: Continuously optimize database queries, indexes, and schema design to improve query performance.
